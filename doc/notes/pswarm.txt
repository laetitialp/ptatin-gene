  Passive Swarm Developer Notes
______________________________
______________________________


* PSwarm does not support JSON checkpointing. This is a current design limitation
which needs to be addressed. Models using pswarms will not be able to completely
checkpointed. A restart will simply re-introduce an un-iniitalised set of passive
particles.

* Only ParaView formats are supported by PSwarm. This should be updated to support
the native databucket binary output. Introducing this feature will require a python
tool which can load the native databucket binary output.
