  Passive Swarm Developer Notes
______________________________
______________________________

* The deformation grid reference file (deformation_grid_ref.vts) is not prefixed 
with the PSwarm options prefix.

* deformation_grid_ref.vts uses ascii format -- gasp --

* PSwarmSetUpCoords_FillBox() does not support using -pswarm_box_nx 1,1,1

* Add UpdateMethods for Temperature, and e_plastic. 

* PSwarm does not support JSON checkpointing. This is a current design limitation
which needs to be addressed. Models using pswarms will not be able to completely
checkpointed. A restart will simply re-introduce an un-iniitalised set of passive
particles.

* Only ParaView formats are supported by PSwarm. This should be updated to support
the native databucket binary output. Introducing this feature will require a python
tool which can load the native databucket binary output.
