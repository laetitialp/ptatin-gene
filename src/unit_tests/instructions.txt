pTatin3d unit tests:

Usage:
  python ptatin3d-execute-tests.py

Caveats:
  - Currently all tests are executed in sequence (this can be quite slow)
  - Unix diff is used to compare the output of the test, with the expected output.
  - No indication is provided if a test passes or fails - that's up to the user to determine.
  This testing suite just RETURNS THE RESULT OF DIFF

Structure:
  - Each test is defined via a single python function which calls one of the ptatin executables
  - A test will usually have its own option file, called
    input/TEST_NAME.opts
  - Each test should generate ptatin output/log files in the directory called pt3dout
  - The stdout from each test is directed into a file named
    output/TEST_NAME.output
  - The expected output from ptatin for each test is located in
    expected/TEST_NAME.expected
  - Specific line markers and line contents are identified and stripped out of both
  the test output (TEST_NAME.output.strip) and the expected file (expected.strip).
  Lines contain (MB) and (sec) are remove primarily as memory usage and cpu time may vary from one machine to another.
  To keep the volume of text to be compared down to a minimum, lines starting with { '**', '[[', '[pTatinModel]', '[pTatin] } are omitted.
  See the variable "bad_words" defined in strip_keywords() for this list.
  - All tests are currently serial only.
