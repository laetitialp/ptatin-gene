 ** 
 **   pTatin3d is a C library specifically designed to solve variable viscosity Stokes flow 
 **   problems in three dimensions using a mixed finite element (FE) formulation (Q2-P1), together
 **   with a marker-and-cell (MAC) discretisations for the coefficients in the underlying PDE. 
 **   Unique to this FE-MAC package is that we provide support for efficient, parallel scalable 
 **   matrix free operators and matrix free operators/smoothers which can be utilized by geometric 
 **   multi-grid preconditioners.
