### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
- Don't forget to [check how commit works](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/add-edit-and-commit-to-source-files/) 

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Check [how pull requests work](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/tutorial-learn-about-bitbucket-pull-requests/)
- Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can make changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-a-git-branch-to-merge-a-file/) to help you with merges.
